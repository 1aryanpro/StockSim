# Stock Market Simulation Program
This program reads information from [twelevedata](https://www.twelevedata.com) using the libcurt library. The twelevedata api gives access to the price history of any public stock symbol. This program can pick from a variety of stock symbols (but it defaults to the famous science and technology companies). Then it displays a graph containing the information collected.
